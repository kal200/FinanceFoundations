                    Unfortunately, financial literacy in the United States is low because of a lack of sufficient exposure to important 
                    concepts in schools and of opportunities to develop sound financial planning and management habits.

                    As a result, 
                    many young adults are ill-equipped to manage their finances, leading them to fall into debt 
                    and financial instability, often worsened by compounding poor decision-making.

                        budgeting for expenses and outlays; the use of debt in a targeted and responsible way; and sound savings and investment.

             <p>Financial literacy education is crucial for understanding core concepts related to building wealth
                and maintaining financial health. Financial literacy helps individuals how to budget, save, invest,
                and manage debt. <br> Per the <a href="https://finrafoundation.org/sites/finrafoundation/files/NFCS-Report-Fifth-Edition-July-2022.pdf" class="landing_link" target="_blank">July 2022 FINRA National Financial Capability Study (NFCS) report</a>, 
                individuals with higher financial literacy are <br> <b>more</b> likely to:

                And <b>less</b> likely to: 
                <ul>
                    <li>Use high-interest/high-risk borrowing methods like auto title or  payday loans</li>
