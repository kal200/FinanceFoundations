                                                    Volatility is the degree of fluctuation or variation in a stock price. A stock with lower volatility
                                                    has more stable prices while a stock with higher volatility tends to have larger price swings.

                                                    An investment's rate of return is the percentage change in the its value over a given period (e.g. annual, monthly). 
                                                    For example, an initial investment of $100 worth $105 after 1 year had an annual rate of return of 5% for this year.

                                                    The Sharpe Ratio is used to measure the excess return  
                                                    an investor receives for holding a riskier (more volatile) asset compared to a risk-free asset, such as 1-year treasury bills. 
                                                    <br> 
                                                    A Sharpe ratio of 1.0 or above is considered good, indicating that the investment is generating strong excess returns relative to the risk. 
                                                    A Sharpe ratio below 1.0 suggests that the investment is generating smaller excess returns relative to the risk.

                                                    Beta is a measure of how volatile a stock is compared to a benchmark index (e.g. the S&P500). A stock
                                                    with a beta of 1 moves 100 percent for every 100 percent move in the benchmark index, meaning it has
                                                    similar volatility, or risk, as the benchmark. A stock with a beta above 1 tends to be more volatile than the
                                                    benchmark index, and vice versa for stocks with beta less than 1.

                                                    The simple moving average is calculated by adding the closing prices of a stock over a given number of periods
                                                    and dividing this sum by the number of periods. For example, to find the 100-day simple moving average for a stock, 
                                                    the sum of its closing prices for the last 100 days is divided by the number of days (100).

                                                    Moving averages, such as the simple moving average, help smooth out short-term
                                                    fluctuations and indicate underlying trends (e.g. upward).
